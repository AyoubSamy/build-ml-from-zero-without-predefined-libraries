##  Build ML From Scratch — Without Predefined Libraries

This repository contains my personal implementations of **Machine Learning algorithms from scratch**, without using libraries  .  
The goal is to understand and implement the mathematical logic behind each algorithm step by step.

### Objectives

1- Understand and implement core machine learning algorithms manually

2- Strengthen mathematical and algorithmic understanding

3- Avoid relying on predefined ML libraries

###  Project Structure
notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for each algorithm

├── 01_linear_regression.ipynb

├── 02_logistic_regression.ipynb # (to be added)

├── 03_knn.ipynb # (to be added)

├── 04_kmeans.ipynb # (to be added)

data/ # Datasets used 

utils/ # Helper functions

>  More algorithms and notebooks will be added progressively as the project evolves.
